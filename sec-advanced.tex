\section{Advanced Hardware Construction in Chisel}
Another way to support hardware facilities in Chisel, as opposed to
building new nodes, is to write a Scala program that aggregates the
features of Chisel from Chapter~\ref{sec:chisel} into a directed graph
of nodes that implement the same hardware functionality. This approach
has the advantage of decoupling the hardware facility from the
backend, making the hardware facility more accessible as it can now be
mapped to more backends. The only requirement on the backend is that
they can support the basic Chisel nodes from
Chapter~\ref{sec:chisel}. Furthermore, the designer is no longer
required to write the code generation function for every single
backend, saving a great deal on designer effort. The rest of this
chapter will show how to implement ListLookup and Vec using only the
basic Chisel nodes presented in Chapter~\ref{sec:chisel}
