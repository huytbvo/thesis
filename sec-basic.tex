\section{Basic Hardware Construction in Chisel}
The Chisel constructs presented in the previous section are adequate
for most hardware circuits. We have in fact built an entire floating
point library using only those constructs. Occasionally, users might
want to leverage syntax available in a target backend from within
Chisel. Suppose for example that a user is having Chisel target a
backend that has support for highly optimized FFT circuits. One way to
leverage this feature is to introduce a new type of {\tt Node} into
Chisel that maps directly to that syntax in the backend. This section
will show how ListLookup, Vec, and When Nodes are implemented to
target Verilog's case statements, arrays, and if statements
respectively.
