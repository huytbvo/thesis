This thesis classifies the different levels of hardware construction
in Chisel. At the first level, users write Chisel code at the
granularity of nodes. The next level of Chisel uses functional
abstraction to group nodes into subgraphs. To illustrate the
differences between these levels, we show how someone would implement
a new hardware facility at both levels of hardware construction. At
the level of hardware construction, users write elaboration time
function that the Chisel compiler invokes on the user's behalf to
construct hardware. We present three examples of writing elaboration
time functions to build hardware.
