This thesis classifies Chisel hardware construction into three
levels. At the first level, users write Chisel code at the
granularity of nodes. The second level of hardware construction uses functional
abstraction to group nodes into subgraphs. To illustrate the
differences between these levels, we show how someone would implement
a new hardware facility at both levels of hardware construction. At
the third level of hardware construction, users write elaboration time
function that the Chisel compiler invokes on the user's behalf to
construct hardware. We present three examples of writing elaboration
time functions to build hardware.
